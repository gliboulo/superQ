# SuperF4 v0.8

2008-09-16:
- Made the detection of Ctrl+Alt+F4 more secure, preventing faulty kills which could happen when SuperF4 didn't receive the keyup of the F4 key.
- Only one instance of SuperF4 can now be run. Starting SuperF4 again will make the first instance add its tray icon if hidden.

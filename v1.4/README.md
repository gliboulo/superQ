# v1.4

- Fixed keyboard input lag. Thanks to Victor Robertson (@vmrob).
- Do not enter xkill mode if Ctrl key is pressed. Ctrl+Win+F4 is a new shortcut to close virtual desktops, so we don't want to prevent that. Thanks to Jos√© Rebelo (@joserebelo).
- Add a process blacklist, with `explorer.exe` in the list by default.

I apologize for my tardiness. I use Windows less and less every year, and I must confess that I have not even been running my own programs when I do. I hope this release makes up for it somewhat. Sorry! Let me know of any new problems by opening issues.
